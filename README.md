# Experiment: Kelvin Double Bridge Method

## Aim
To determine the value of a very low unknown resistance (S) using the Kelvin Double Bridge method.

## Apparatus Required
- DC supply (12V)  
- Kelvin Double Bridge setup  
- Rheostat (Rs)  
- Ammeter  
- Voltmeter / Millivoltmeter  
- Unknown low resistance (S)  
- Connecting wires  

## Procedure
1. Set the voltage (V = 12V) and switch on the board. Keep Switch (S) in **Short** mode and adjust the rheostat (Rs) to maintain the current at **2A, 3A, 4A, or 5A**.  
2. Set Switch (S) to **Open** mode and set the low resistance value within **0.001 to 0.01 Ω** from the "Set The Unknown Resistance S" box.  
3. Set Switch (S) to **Bridge** mode and Switch (K) to **Open** mode.  
4. Vary the values of **RA, RB, Ra, and Rb** from the control box or directly enter the values until the millivoltmeter shows **zero deflection**.  
5. Now, set Switch (K) to **Close** mode and again vary **RA, RB, Ra, and Rb** to achieve **zero deflection**.  
6. Once "NULL" is achieved, click on **Calculate** in the "Calculated Unknown Resistance Value" box to obtain the resistance value of the unknown resistor (S).

## Result
The value of the unknown low resistance (S) was successfully measured using the **Kelvin Double Bridge method**.
